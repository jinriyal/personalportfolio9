<p>This netflix series The Playlist then caught people's attention due to Spotify's popularity. The initial episode focuses on the impact of Pirate Bay and Napster's immense success on the global music scene. The script is skillfully crafted, featuring delightful dialogue and well-paced storytelling. If this episode is indicative of what's to come, the rest of the show promises to be highly entertaining. The characters in the show were really great about their role. They gave off facial expressions, increased voice, etc., just appropriate to the different scenes. The show personally interests me, making me feel thrilled in every scene. At the same time, I wasn't able to track the time of the episode and it made me feel disappointed when episode one ended because I think the last part of that episode made me feel excited. Overall, I think this would really be a great series if I only have a chance to watch all the episodes of it, it would really be lovely.
