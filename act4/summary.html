<p>The netflix series, "The Playlist", episode one, "The Vision", shows how Daniel Ek came up with the idea of making a free music live streaming application, the spotify. But before that, he had a tough life. He tried to apply to Google but he wasn't hired because Google was looking for someone with a diploma. He got mad and hacked Google and did something terribly bad to the company. He got more mad and isolated himself in his apartment. Here he decided to make a marketing firm. After a lot of sleepless nights, and ready to eat bought foods, he was finally done making the marketing firm Advertigo and sold it to  the Swedish company Tradedoubler for millions. Daniel Ek was watching the news and the issue of the free music website caught his attention. He thought he could make a free music live streaming application wherein anyone can upload his or her own song freely. He imagined it to have great features such as collaboratively creating playlists, and a lot more. He asked the person who bought Advertigo for assistance, Martin Lorentzon. That very day, he rushed to Mr. Lorentzon and asked for his collaboration. Daniel Ek knew someone who can make the codings for them too. They gathered those people, and made a team and started to make the desired app of Daniel. However, troubles are always on the way. They were having trouble gaining music copyrights. From that day, he and his team give their very best to gain music copyrights with the idea of persuading teenagers.
