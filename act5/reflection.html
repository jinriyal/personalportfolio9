<p>As you watch the series, you would realise the connection of the scenes shown in real life. When Daniel Ekâ€™s job application wasn't accepted by Google, it shows that in life, we will always experience rejections. Dealing with it, we must be mature enough to accept it, improve ourselves, move forward, and maybe try again. Additionally, in the last scene of episode 1, it depicts that life is not easy, we will always encounter obstacles. However, it is not to ruin us, but to strengthen us. It is to make us realise our mistakes and we may improve through it. Life is hard but all we need to do is go with the flow and always think positive.
